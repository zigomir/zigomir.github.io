I was always a "IDE person". Since my mid-school days I was taught how to use one.
Started with Delphi, then on to Visual Studio, Eclipse and later IntelliJ IDEA.

Especially last one stuck with me. I love what JetBrains are doing. I got used to
their shortcuts, features and all the goodies they provide. Especially hardcore
backup-ing (Local history) of everything you ever write. Even if you somehow
delete whole directory by mistake you can easily get it back with this feature.

What turned me down at last are two things. First one is memory consumption. I
know memory is getting cheaper every day and we have more of it but there are
other applications that are getting heavier every day too. Second one, and more
related to my switch, was coupling with tools / framework decisions and such.

I'm talking about `Ruby on Rails` decision to support
[spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) out of the box. I love it, it makes
everything faster. But then `Ruby Mine` doesn't have support for it yet. This
was my turning point. I don't want to be so dependent to my tools of choice.
I know that in near future this will be fixed in RubyMine (update: it's fixed).

And also I'm working on two machines. One is a desktop PC running Windows and
another is MacBook Air. To have same environment on both computers I use this
[nice trick](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11365948/how-to-save-restore-sublime-text-2-configs-plugins-to-migrate-to-another-compute) to sync all
`Sublime Text` configuration files and have same look and feel on both machines.

I tried to be efficient in `VIM` for so many times that I'm kinda loosing hope
there. At the end, what I'm all about is to get work done and editor should not
stand in my way. I know it can enhance your productivity and efficiency but
maybe a drop from IDE directly to VIM is a too big for me.

`Update:` I'm still coming back to JetBrains products. What bugs me the most with
ST is that fuzzy search feature won't remember what was my last search. I'm so used
to have it like that. I hope [new editor](https://atom.io/) might be a better
choice and I'll be able to customize it myself since it's written in {Java,Coffee}Script.
