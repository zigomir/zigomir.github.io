## Removing

Over past 12 months I got rid of few things. In previous winter I started with
TV and XBOX. Then around spring I let go my gaming capable desktop computer.
This fall my car finally become immobile so I sold it.
Additional computer screen and mouse started to feel redundant and were removed.
Today I got rid of my oldest T-Shirts.

Only thing I bought were 2.1 speakers because old 5.1 set couldn't be used with
laptop.

2014 for me was definitely a year of removing things from my life. It feels as
good as removing (dead) code.
